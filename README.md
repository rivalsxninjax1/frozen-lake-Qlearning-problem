# FrozenLake Q-Learning Example

This project demonstrates the application of the Q-Learning algorithm using the [FrozenLake-v1](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) environment from the OpenAI Gym library. In this example, an agent learns to navigate the slippery frozen lake by balancing exploration and exploitation to maximize the cumulative reward.

## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent interacts with an environment, takes actions, and learns policies to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. In this project, we implement a simple version of the Q-Learning algorithm—a model-free RL algorithm—to solve the FrozenLake environment.

## Environment Overview

The FrozenLake environment is a grid-world where:
- **States:** Represent the cells in the grid.
- **Actions:** Include moves such as left, right, up, and down.
- **Rewards:** The agent receives a reward when it reaches the goal and a penalty (or zero reward) if it falls into a hole or wanders off the optimal path.

For more information, check the [Gym documentation](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/).

## Algorithm Details

**Q-Learning:**  
The Q-Learning algorithm used in this project follows these steps:
1. **Initialize the Q-table:** A table with dimensions corresponding to the number of states and the number of possible actions, initially set to zeros.
2. **Action Selection:**  
   - **Exploration:** Choose a random action based on the exploration rate (epsilon).  
   - **Exploitation:** Choose the action with the highest Q-value for the current state.
3. **Update Q-Table:** Use the Bellman equation to update the Q-values:
   \[
   Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right)
   \]
4. **Epsilon Decay:** Gradually reduce the exploration rate over time.
